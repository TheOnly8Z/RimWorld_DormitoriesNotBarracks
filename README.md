# RimWorld_DormitoriesNotBarracks
The difference between bedroom and barracks bonuses is extreme. This mod adds dormitories, a room type that creates a compromise solution!

## Feature
Dormitories are defined as rooms with 2-3 single beds (even a single and a double bed would turn it into a barrack). They provide thoughts that are better than that of barracks, but worse than bedrooms.
